                    <p>
                        Pasta (US: /ˈpɑːstə/, UK: /ˈpæstə/; 
                        Italian pronunciation: [ˈpasta]) is 
                        a type of food typically made from 
                        an unleavened dough of wheat flour 
                        mixed with water or eggs, and formed 
                        into sheets or other shapes, then 
                        cooked by boiling or baking. Rice 
                        flour, or legumes such as beans or 
                        lentils, are sometimes used in place 
                        of wheat flour to yield a different 
                        taste and texture, or as a 
                        gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a 
                        staple food of Italian cuisine.

                    <h2>Etymology</h2>
                    <p>
                        First attested in English in 1873, 
                        the word pasta comes from Italian 
                        pasta, in turn from Latin pasta, 
                        latinisation of the Greek παστά, 
                        pasta, 'barley porridge'.

                        <p>
                            Since at least the time of 
                            Cato's De Agri Cultura, basic 
                            pasta dough has been made mostly 
                            of wheat flour or semolina,[4] 
                            with durum wheat used 
                            predominantly in the South of 
                            Italy and soft wheat in the 
                            North. Regionally other grains 
                            have been used, including those 
                            from barley, buckwheat, rye, 
                            rice, and maize, as well as 
                            chestnut and chickpea flours.

                        To address the needs of people 
                        affected by gluten-related disorders 
                        (such as coeliac disease, non-celiac 
                        gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy 
                        sufferers),[31] some recipes use 
                        rice or maize for making pasta. 
                        Grain flours may also be 
                        supplemented with cooked potatoes.

                        Other additions to the basic 
                        flour-liquid mixture may include 
                        vegetable purees such as spinach or 
                        tomato, mushrooms, cheeses, herbs, 
                        spices and other seasonings. While 
                        pastas are, most typically, made 
                        from unleavened doughs, the use of 
                        yeast-raised doughs are also known 
                        for at least nine different pasta 
                        forms.[4]

                        Additives in dried, commercially 
                        sold pasta include vitamins and 
                        minerals that are lost from the 
                        durum wheat endosperm during milling.
                         They are added back to the semolina 
                         flour once it is ground, creating 
                         enriched flour. Micronutrients 
                         added may include niacin 
                         (vitamin B3), riboflavin 
                         (vitamin B2), folate, thiamine 
                         (vitamin B1), and ferrous iron.[34]
