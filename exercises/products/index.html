                        Meet Bella, the enchanting frog with
                        a unique penchant for perching atop 
                        people's heads. This charismatic 
                        amphibian has an insatiable appetite
                        for succulent strawberries, and her 
                        eyes positively sparkle when she 
                        spies this delectable treat. Yet, 
                        Bella's most endearing pastime is 
                        her fascination with watching cats 
                        slumber. She's a charming and 
                        eccentric companion, turning heads 
                        with her delightful quirks and 
                        captivating personality.

                        Introducing Crowbar, the quirky frog
                        with a penchant for the unusual. 
                        Crowbar's favorite pastime involves 
                        nibbling on the fingertips of anyone 
                        willing to indulge his peculiar 
                        curiosity, leaving a trail of 
                        bemused smiles in his wake. But it's 
                        under the running sink water where 
                        he truly comes alive, reveling in 
                        the sensation of tiny droplets 
                        cascading over his skin. Yet, 
                        Crowbar's most fascinating quirk is 
                        his obsession with the bathroom 
                        mirror, where he stares at his own 
                        reflection for hours, leaving one 
                        to wonder if he sees something 
                        extraordinary in himself that the 
                        world has yet to discover.

                        Introducing Paddle, the strikingly 
                        blue and intimidating-looking frog 
                        with a heart full of warmth. Despite 
                        his fearsome appearance, Paddle 
                        adores cuddles and is known for 
                        melting hearts with his affectionate 
                        nature. He has a particular fondness 
                        for kissing people on their noses, 
                        leaving behind a trail of laughter 
                        and smiles. Paddle also relishes the 
                        gentle touch of head pats, reminding 
                        us that appearances can be deceiving, 
                        and that there's a soft and loving 
                        side to everyone, no matter how they 
                        may seem at first glance.
