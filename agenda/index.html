                Today, we are going to learn about Side-by-Side Content Layouts. We've worked with these in the past but we'll get into a few  distinct ones today.

                    First, we start off with a powerpoint
                    on Side-by-Side Content Layouts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then we have a large demo that will
                    be broken up into three parts. We'll
                    start off with the Three Cards part
                    and then move on to the Media & Text
                    part.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After a short break, we'll do the
                    final part of our demo, the
                    Comparison Tables.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Afterwards, you'll be given time to start and work on the Product Comparison Page Exercise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If time permits, we'll finish up our
                    Animagram Cards.

                    — If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space, they will bond and be permanently stuck together. This is due to an effect called cold welding where the atos of the individual pieces of metal have no way of knowing that they are different pieces of metal, so the lumps join together. I wonder if that could happen to humans in space. <span id="smiley">&#128563;</span>
