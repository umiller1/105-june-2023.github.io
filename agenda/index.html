                <strong>Good evening everyone!</strong>
                <!-- Rejoice, for today is Friday!<br> -->
                Today, we will be finishing up our Margin and Padding Drills. We'll also
                start our Upside-down Tetris exercise. Then, we'll get into combining
                CSS Selectors and our Box Framing Exercise.
            </p>

            <ul id="timeline">
                <li>
                    We'll start off with our Padding Drills
                    followed by our Margin Drills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, you'll be given some time to work
                    on the Upside-down Tetris Exercise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After a short break, wee have a presentation
                    and demo on Combining Selectors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then we'll have Container and Selector
                    Drills followed by the Box Framing exercise
                    if time permits.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <em>
                    â€” Supermarket apples can be up to a year old at purchase. Farmers often harvest in the fall, cover them in wax and hot-air dry them. They're then put into cold storage, keeping them edible for 6-12 months.
