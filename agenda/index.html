                <strong>Good evening everyone!</strong>
                <!-- Rejoice, for today is Friday!<br> -->
                Today, we'll be learning about one of the
                fundamental building blocks of html and css:
                Document Flow. Before that, we have a fun
                and colorful exercise to complete!
            </p>

            <ul id="timeline">
                <li>
                    We'll start off with the Color Palettes
                    exercise. I will do a short demo on how
                    to complete it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, we have a review kahoot on CSS
                    Rules which will be followed by a short
                    10 minute break.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Afterwards, we have a presentation on
                    Document Flow and a demo on Divs, Spans
                    and Flow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From there, we'll have a set of drills
                    on Document Flow which will be followed
                    by the Bulletin Board Exercise if time
                    permits.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <strong>Daily Fun Fact</strong>
                <em>
                    â€” Scotland's national animal is the
