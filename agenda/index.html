                <strong>Good evening everyone!</strong>
                Rejoice, for today is Friday!<br>
                Today, we'll be getting into CSS
                fundamentals. You were introduced yesterday 
                but let's dive in deeper!
            </p>

            <ul id="timeline">
                <li>
                    We'll start off with refresher on the
                    Intro to CSS presentation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, we have a demo on CSS Colors and
                    Text styling which will be followed by
                    Basic CSS Drills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Afterwards, you'll be given some class
                    time to work on and complete the Color
                    Palettes exercise.
                </li>
