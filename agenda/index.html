                <strong>Good evening everyone!</strong>
                <!-- Rejoice, for today is Friday!<br> -->
                Today, we'll be learning about another one
                of the foundational concepts in CSS - The
                Box Model. Before we do that, we'll finish
                our Document Flow drills from yesterday and
                work on our Bulletin Board exercise. 
            </p>

            <ul id="timeline">
                <li>
                    We'll start off finishing the remaining
                    drills for our Document Flow drills 
                    exercise which will be followed by the
                    Bulletin Board exercise
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then after a short 10 minute break, we have a presentation and demo
                    on the Box Model which is followed by
                    a 3 separate sets of drills for each
                    component of the box model - Border drills
                    Padding Drills, and Margin drills. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If time permits, we'll move on to the
                    Upside-down Tetris exercise and our
                    Document Flow review kahoot.
