                    — Pumpkins are 90% water. They float in
                    water. They're fruits. Most pumpkins are
                    orange due to the pigment carotene which
                    is also found in carrots. Pumpkins are
                    grown everywhere except Antartica. Every
                    single part of a pumpkin is edible 
                    including the root, stem, leaves, fruit,
                    and its seeds.
