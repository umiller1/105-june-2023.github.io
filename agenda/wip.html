                    — Many casinos, malls, and big-box stores intentionally aim to cause their visitors <i><b>temporal distortion</b></i> so that they may stay longer and spend more money. Temporal distortion, also known as time distortion, changes
                    your perception of time which often causes you to
                    spend more time than you had originally planned on
                    an activity or task.
