                <strong>Good evening everyone!</strong>
                <!-- Rejoice, for today is Friday!<br> -->
                Today, we will continue the second half of our Combining Selectors demo and get into the Containers and Selectors Drills and Box Framing Exercise. Then, we'll move on to start learning about responsive web development.

                    We'll start off finishing our second part of
                    the deja-vu demo for Combining Selectors which
                    will be followed by the Containers and Selectors Drills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After, you'll be given time to start and work on your
                    Box Framing Exercise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After a short break, we have a presentation on Responsiveness
                    - Part 1 followed by a demo on Absolute vs Relative Units.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then we'll have a two review kahoots on Document Flow and
                    CSS Selectors to English.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Afterwards, you'll be given time to start your Final Project
                    Checkpoint - About Me. If time permits, you'll also be given
                    time to start your Generic License project.
